Ket *: ,"- Hutan  Tanaman berdasarkan penafsiran citra adalah  penutupan lahan  hutan yang merupakan hasil budidaya  manusia, meliputi seluruh  Hutan  Tanaman baik Hutan  Tanaman Industri/IUPHHK-HT maupun Hutan  Tanaman yang merupakan hasil reboisasi/penghijauan yang berada di dalam  maupun di luar kawasan hutan; terlihat  dari citra mempunyai pola tanam yang teratur pada  area datar, sedangkan untuk  daerah bergelombang terlihat  warna  citra yang berbeda dgn lingkungan sekitarnya. Deforestasi  pada  Hutan Tanaman di dalam  kawasan hutan KSA-KPA dan/atau HL , tidak diklasifikasikan sebagai  Hutan  Tanaman Industri/IUPHHK-HT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,- Deforesatasi Netto: perubahan/pengurangan luas penutupan lahan dengan kategori berhutan pada kurun waktu tertentu yang diperoleh dari perhitungan luas deforestasi bruto dikurangi dengan luas reforestasi. Angka deforestasi netto bernilai negatif artinya terjadi reforestasi  yang lebih besar dibandingkan deforestasi bruto.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
